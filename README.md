# About magix projects

* You code using COFFEESCRIPT.
* No HTML, no CSS, no javascript required.
* No need for anything else out of the box.
* To create a class, create a new file and write: 

> Extends View

> this.background = red

> this.didAppear = ->

> 	say 'hi'

## .. Instead of the traditional 'class' keyword

* One class per file

* Classes are auto imported by default. 
To import classes manually, add a '!' at the very beggining of you file.
Then:
> Import 'MyFirstView', ->

> log 'imported'

## In case you are wondering, 'log' is the print method, short and cool ;)

> log 'something :P'
